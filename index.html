      language</li>
    <li>head element which contains every thing about the webpage which I am not going to show in my body, things like
      the page title which will be
      shown on the browser tab, and also in search engines. meta element with charset attribute which specifiy the
      charset, meta element with
      name='viewport' content='width=device-width' which means to open the page with the device view port width.</li>
    <li>body which contains everything which is going to be shown to the users like:
      <ul>
        <li>heading elements which include h1 to h6 and should be used to specify titles and headings. it is important
          in ceo and accessiblity.</li>
        <li>p elements for paragraphs</li>
        <li>img element which is a void element and has src(source) attribute to specify the location of the image and
          alt attribute which specify
          the alternative for the image whenever the image is not available or for accessiblity. the alt attribute
          should describe the image so that
          someone with disablities can also understand what the image is</li>
